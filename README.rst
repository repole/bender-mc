REST API server providing access to my home media center, controlled by
home-assistant and rhasspy.

Everything in here is super messy and specific to my own home setup, and very
much still a constantly evolving WIP.

Attempt to use at your own frustration.

Dependencies
------------
Windows (sorry)
chromedriver.exe
SoundVolumeView.exe

Make sure both executables are in your path.
